# Stickman Tournament

A Local multiplayer game made for the SOFA JAM: https://itch.io/jam/sofa-jam
Requires 2 players, and 2 controllers to play.

Was initially planning on adding more content such as more games and some polishing, but felt like I did enough for this game jam. I didn't use a game engine as well, which made some stuff harder for me to implement from scratch.

It was the first game jam I ever participated, and I don't think I did bad. Hope yall enjoy :)
